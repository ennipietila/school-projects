/*
 * This module cleans the data in 'data/corpus.png' for this exercise.
 * The code is not particularly high-quality, but you are welcome
 * to take a look.
 *
 * You should not edit this file, with one exception.
 * You can change the random seed '123' to 'g' if you want.
 * (However, you should not assume in 'classifier.scala' that
 * the objects in this file are available.
 * This will not be the case when you submit the code for grading.)
